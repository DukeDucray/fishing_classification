#fishing_classification
Our goal for this project is to have an API that take a vessel position history to determine if the boat is fishing, when and where.

Our application will display the data on a map with different color maker.
Additionally, we are running a second model that would determine which fishing gear is being used by the vessel based on the fishing pattern.

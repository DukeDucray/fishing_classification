## Once we have these, let's call our API in order to retrieve a prediction

See ? No need to load a `model.joblib` file in this app, we do not even need to know anything about Data Science in order to retrieve a prediction...

ðŸ¤” How could we call our API ? Off course... The `requests` package ðŸ’¡

url = 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict'

if url == 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict':

    st.markdown('Maybe you want to use your own API for the prediction, not the one provided by Le Wagon...')

'''

2. Let's build a dictionary containing the parameters for our API...

3. Let's call our API using the `requests` package...

4. Let's retrieve the prediction from the **JSON** returned by the API...

## Finally, we can display the prediction to the user
